The Thirsty Hipster App
======================

This was originally an Epicodus Exercise, but has grown into a side project. 

Summary
--------
Thirsty Hipster is a Rails app that allows users to add and review local happy hours. It accesses the Yelp API to prepoulate fields and it will eventually map location using Google maps API. 

User Stories
-----------
* As a thirsty hipster, I want to find an organic locally-brewed DoppleBock after a long day of rolling cigarettes and spinning vinyl.
* As a thirsty hipster, I want to know where I can procure a discount beverage so that I can stretch my fedora budget.
* As a thirsty hipster, I want to know which bars are overlooked and underappreciated, so that I can drop references to obscure taprooms in casual conversation.
* As a thirsty hipster, I want to utilize a self-referential service to satisfy my wry sense of humor and well-developed sense of irony.
